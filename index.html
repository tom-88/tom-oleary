    I'm a PhD student at the University of Oxford taking part in the Computational Discovery DTC. I'm funded (by EPSRC & IBM) to do research into near term quantum algorithms. Particular areas of focus are quantum simulation and controlling quantum errors. 

    I worked at Los Alamos National Lab as during Summer 22 as part of 
    their Quantum Computing Summer School.

    I have an MSci in Physics and Computer Science from Durham University where my thesis (which
    can be read on the 'projects page') was supervised by Viv Kendon and Nick Chancellor. In between graduating and starting the PhD I worked as a 
    software engineer at Elsevier in London.

    In general I'm interested in quantum computing, with quantum algorithms and error mitigation being particular areas of focus.
